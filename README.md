# AMR Demo: ROS2 Integration

This tutorial goes through the setup of a Unity warehouse environment with an autonomous mobile robot (AMR) based on a [TurtleBot 3](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/) and integration with ROS 2. You'll setup the basic scene to perform simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and visualize the map using Rviz. By completing this tutorial, you will gain experience in the following tasks:

 - Unity Scene setup and asset usage
 - Importing a robot into Unity
 - Importing Unity robotics packages
 - Connecting Unity to a ROS 2
 - Performing SLAM with the robot

To skip the tutorial and run the demo already setup, use our Quick Demo.

## System setup and requirements

In this section, you will get the correct version of Unity installed, supporting software like Docker, required Unity Packages, and be ready to start your Unity project.

## Setting up the Unity scene

In this section, you will set the Unity warehouse scene setup. This includes importing the TurtleBot 3 using the URDF Importer package and setting up prefabs in the scene.

## ROS 2 setup

In this section, you will use a provided Docker container with ROS 2 software to simulate the robot functionality. This section also includes instructions to for running the ROS 2 software locally.

## Performing autonomous navigation

In this section, you will use Unity with the ROS 2 software running in order to perform autonomous navigation using the TurtleBot 3
